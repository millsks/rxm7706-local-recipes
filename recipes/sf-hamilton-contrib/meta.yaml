    "Off-the-shelf Hamilton Dataflows
    Here you'll find documentation about the sf-hamilton-contrib package that curates a collection of Hamilton Dataflows that are ready to be used in your own projects. They are user-contributed and maintained, with the goal of making it easier for you to get started with Hamilton.
    We expect this collection to grow over time, so check back often! As dataflows become mature we will move them into the official sub-package of the respository and become maintained by the Hamilton team"
